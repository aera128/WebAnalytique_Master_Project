The graph in the file represents the coauthorship network of scientists
working on network theory and experiment.
These data is based on the bibliographies of two review
articles on networks, SIAM Review 45, 167-256 (2003) and
Physics Reports 424, 175-308 (2006), with a few
additional references added by hand.
The network is weighted in nature.
